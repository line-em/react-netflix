# React Netflix Clone

This was a comprehensive project! I'm really enjoying its process ðŸŽ‰

I used [this video as a guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATz8wg6sg30), and it was wonderful in explaining a lot of new technologies for me (**Tailwind and Firebase**, mostly). However, I did some things differently, like using the **useRef hook**, adding **loading and error states**, extra hover and active effects. Also, I'm using tools and libraries that I'm more comfortable with, such as **Vite** instead of CRA, and **Phosphor Icons**, which is a delightful library I love to use. While I loved the guide, I just feel that I learn better if I deviate a little, not following it 100%. ðŸ˜Š

Contrary to my other projects, I decided that for this one, I ought to stick closer to the original Netflix design, and focus more on the other functionalities instead of the CSS.
