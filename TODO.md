<!-- USE CONTEXT -->

    Using useMemo: You can use the useMemo hook to only re-render the component when the user state changes. This can be done by wrapping the AuthContextProvider component in a call to useMemo, like so:

export const AuthContextProvider = ({ children }) => {
const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
const value = useMemo(() => ({ signUp, logIn, logOut, user }), [user]);

    // rest of the code

    Updating Firestore documents: Instead of using setDoc to set the user's saved movies in Firestore, you could use the update method to update the document. This can be done by changing the following line:

setDoc(doc(db, `users`, email), {
savedMovies: []
});

to:

doc(db, `users`, email).update({ savedMovies: [] });

    Server-side Cloud Functions: Firebase Cloud Functions can be used to perform some of the logic, this can offload some of the processing from the client-side. For example, you could move the logic of creating and updating Firestore documents to Cloud Functions, this will reduce the load on the client-side and improve the performance.

Note that it's important to measure the performance of your application before and after making these changes to see if they have the desired effect. Additionally, you may need to profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks and make further improvements.

<!-- ABOUT MOVIES.JSX COMPONENT -->

Here are a few ways to potentially improve this code:

    useEffect and dependencies: You are currently using two useEffect hooks and calling the doc function twice. Instead, you can use one useEffect hook and call the doc function only once, passing the user object as a dependency to the hook, like so:

useEffect(() => {
if(user) {
movieRef = doc(db, `users`, `${user.email}`);
getLikedMovies(movieRef);
}
}, [user]);

    getLikedMovies function : Instead of using filter method to check if the movie is liked or not, you can use the some method in the getLikedMovies function to check if the movie is liked or not, like so:

const getLikedMovies = async (movieRef) => {
const doc = await getDoc(movieRef);
const likedMovies = doc?.data()?.savedMovies;
setIsLiked(likedMovies.some((movie) => movie.id === movie.id));
};

<!-- ADITIONAL QUERY -->

The filter method is used to filter elements of an array based on a condition, and it returns a new array containing all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. On the other hand, the some method is used to check if at least one element in an array passes a test implemented by the provided function.

In this case, you want to check if the current movie is liked, so you don't need to return all the movies that are liked, instead you just need to know if the current movie is liked or not, so you can use the some method to check if the current movie is in the liked movies array.

Here is an example of how you can use the filter method to return all the liked movies:

const getLikedMovies = async (movieRef) => {
const doc = await getDoc(movieRef);
const likedMovies = doc?.data()?.savedMovies;
return likedMovies.filter((movie) => movie.id === movie.id);
};

And then you can use the returned likedMovies array to render all the liked movies.

It's worth noting that you have to be aware of the size of the array, as it could have a performance impact if the array is too big.

<!-- END OF ADITIONAL QUERY -->

    handleLike function : Instead of using the updateDoc method twice, you can use a ternary operator to check if the movie is liked or not, and then call updateDoc with the appropriate arrayUnion or arrayRemove method, like so:

const handleLike = async () => {
if (user) {
await updateDoc(movieRef, {
savedMovies: isLiked ? arrayRemove({
id: movie.id,
title: movie.title,
img: movie.backdrop_path
}) : arrayUnion({
id: movie.id,
title: movie.title,
img: movie.backdrop_path
})
});
setIsLiked(!isLiked);
} else {
alert("Please log in to save your favorites");
}
};

It's worth noting that without more context on the specific use case and how this code is being used in your application, it's difficult to provide more specific recommendations. Additionally, you may need to profile and measure performance to determine if any of the changes you make are having the desired effect.
